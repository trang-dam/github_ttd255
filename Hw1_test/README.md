##PUI 2016 Homework 1

###For assignment 1: 
1. I created the local repository on my machine named Gittest_ttd255 and and merge it with the Github repository(Link: https://github.com/ttd255/gittest_ttd255). For the second part, I created a conflict and merged the conflicts in the two repositories
2. I pulled a merge request on my parnert's repository, Laura Bligh(Link: https://github.com/ttd255/gittest_lbligh) and accepted her merge request.

###For assignment 2:
I uploaded two screenshots to my remote directory on Github(Link). Achilles Saxby helped me on the part of Assignment 2 about setting the environmental variable and the alias. I was confused between the .bashrc and .bash_profile so thanks to his explanation, I understand that I need to use .bashrc since I was working on a compute. He also showed me the code " nano .bashrc" that oppened the text file so I could create the enviromental variabe PUI2016 and the alias pui2016 as shown in Firgure 1 below. Figure 2 shows my commands for oppening and modifying the .bashrc file.
