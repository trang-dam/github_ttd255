I was confused between the .bashrc and .bash_profile so thanks to his explanation, I understand that I need to use .bashrc since I was working on a compute. He also showed me the code " nano .bashrc" that oppened the text file so I could create the enviromental variabe PUI2016 and the alias pui2016 as shown in Firgure 1 below. Figure 2 shows my commands for oppening and modifying the .bashrc file.
